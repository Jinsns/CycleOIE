Tokyo (ˈtoʊkioʊ, Japanese: toːkʲoː), officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital city of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures.	placeholder
The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world.	placeholder
It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government.	placeholder
Tokyo is in the Kantō region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.	placeholder
Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters.	placeholder
It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo.	placeholder
Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi).	placeholder
Tokyo is often referred to as a city, but is officially known and governed as a "metropolitan prefecture", which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo.	placeholder
The Tokyo metropolitan government administers the 23 Special Wards of Tokyo (each governed as an individual city), which cover the area that was the City of Tokyo before it merged and became the metropolitan prefecture in 1943.	placeholder
The metropolitan government also administers 39 municipalities in the western part of the prefecture and the two outlying island chains.	placeholder
The population of the special wards is over 9 million people, with the total population of the prefecture exceeding 13 million.	placeholder
The prefecture is part of the world's most populous metropolitan area with upwards of 37.8 million people and the world's largest urban agglomeration economy.	placeholder
In 2011, the city hosted 51 of the Fortune Global 500 companies, the highest number of any city in the world, at that time.	placeholder
Tokyo ranked third (twice) in the International Financial Centres Development IndexEdit.	placeholder
The city is also home to various television networks such as Fuji TV, Tokyo MX, TV Tokyo, TV Asahi, Nippon Television, NHK and the Tokyo Broadcasting System.	placeholder
Finnish police reprimanded a man for traveling in a car boot to hide his meeting with Prime Minister Juha Sipila during a government crisis last summer, saying this was breach of the traffic code.	placeholder
A police statement did not name the man in the boot, but in effect indicated the traveler was State Secretary Samuli Virtanen, who is also the deputy to Foreign Minister Timo Soini.	placeholder
The meeting took place in June, a day after Virtanen’s co-ruling Finns party had elected anti-immigration hardliners as its new leaders.	placeholder
The government was close to collapse until a group of politicians, including Virtanen and Soini, in the following week walked out of the Finns party and announced they would form a new group.	placeholder
The Finns party was thrown out of the government and the new “Blue Reform” group kept its cabinet seat.	placeholder
Virtanen has not commented on the case, but lawmaker Tiina Elovaara from Blue Reform said in a blog that Virtanen climbed into the boot to keep the meeting secret at a critical moment.	placeholder
“He avoided media attention when the situation was most serious, and the risk of leakage about the parliamentarians’ transition was too big,” Elovaara said.	placeholder
Chilly Gonzales (born Jason Charles Beck; 20 March 1972) is a Grammy-winning Canadian musician who resided in Paris, France for several years, and now lives in Cologne, Germany.	placeholder
Known for his albums of classical piano compositions with a pop music sensibility, Solo Piano I and Solo Piano II, as well as his MC and electro albums, he is also a producer and songwriter.	placeholder
Gonzales broadcasts a web series Pop Music Masterclass on WDR, the documentary Classical Connections on BBC Radio 1, The History of Music on Arte, and Music's Cool with Chilly Gonzales on Apple Music's Beats1 radio show.	placeholder
He has written several newspaper and magazine opinion pieces in The Guardian, Vice, Billboard, and others.	placeholder
He is the younger brother of the prolific film composer Christophe Beck.	placeholder
Gonzales was born on 20 March 1972.	placeholder
His parents are Ashkenazi Jews who had to flee from Hungary during World War II.	placeholder
Gonzales began teaching himself piano at age three, when his older brother Chris began taking lessons.	placeholder
Gonzales graduated from Crescent School in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.	placeholder
He was classically trained as a pianist at McGill University, where he began both his composing career, co-authoring several musicals with his brother, and his performing career, as a jazz virtuoso.	placeholder
In statistics, an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method to find maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of parameters in statistical models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables.	placeholder
The EM iteration alternates between performing an expectation (E) step, which creates a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters, and a maximization (M) step, which computes parameters maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the E step.	placeholder
These parameter-estimates are then used to determine the distribution of the latent variables in the next E step.	placeholder
The EM algorithm was explained and given its name in a classic 1977 paper by Arthur Dempster, Nan Laird, and Donald Rubin.	placeholder
They pointed out that the method had been "proposed many times in special circumstances" by earlier authors.	placeholder
A very detailed treatment of the EM method for exponential families was published by Rolf Sundberg in his thesis and several papers following his collaboration with Per Martin-Löf and Anders Martin-Löf.	placeholder
The Dempster–Laird–Rubin paper in 1977 generalized the method and sketched a convergence analysis for a wider class of problems.	placeholder
Regardless of earlier inventions, the innovative Dempster–Laird–Rubin paper in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society received an enthusiastic discussion at the Royal Statistical Society meeting with Sundberg calling the paper "brilliant".	placeholder
The Dempster–Laird–Rubin paper established the EM method as an important tool of statistical analysis.	placeholder
After a year of relatively healthy global economic growth, economists are predicting pretty much the same for 2018 -- a neither too-hot nor too-cold Goldilocks scenario, but with little sight of the three bears.	placeholder
The idea is that all is pretty much on track for growth that will be stronger than in 2017.	placeholder
Part of this may come from the fact that forecasters generally got it wrong last year, underclubbing this year’s economic performance, particularly for the euro zone and Japan.	placeholder
The International Monetary Fund, for example, saw 2017 global growth at 3.4 percent with advanced economies advancing 1.8 percent.	placeholder
It now reckons them at 3.6 percent and 2.2 percent.	placeholder
It had the euro zone and Japan growing 1.5 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively.	placeholder
It now has them at 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent.	placeholder
“Faster growth is reaching roughly two-thirds of the world’s population,” the IMF said in a December blog post.	placeholder
This performance has made some economists optimistic.	placeholder
Nomura is among the more bullish: “Global growth has far more self-reinforcing characteristics at present than at any time over the last 20-30 years.”	placeholder
But Goldilock’s bears do have a habit of showing up.	placeholder
There are huge numbers of potential political and economic risks to the status quo.	placeholder
But as in the fairy tale, let’s go with just three: central banks, trade, and bubbles.	placeholder
In the first case, the danger is that there will be a policy mistake, squeezing debtors.	placeholder
The second relates to renewed U.S. protectionism or anger over Chinese exports triggering tit-for-tat, growth-stifling trade barriers.	placeholder
The third is about sudden market losses that dry up spending and demand.	placeholder
